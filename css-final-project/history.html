    <h2>18th and 19th Centuries</h2>
    <p>Before Nashville was even a city, in 1689 Martin Chartier built a trading post close to where the city is now. Years later, a group of French traders then established a settlement where the location of downtown Nashville is today. Nashville got its name from Francis Nash who was an American Revolutionary War hero.
        Tennessee sided with the Confederates during the Civil War and Nashville was the first state capital to fall to the Union in 1862. After the Civil War, Nashville suffered a cholera epidemic. While the city was rebuilding and things were going well, there were several lynchings of blacks. This was a dark time in Nashville's history as segregation grew after trying to rebuild.
