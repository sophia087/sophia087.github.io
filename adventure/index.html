<p style="font-family:candara;">We made our first stop of the Disney World trip at <em>Magic Kingdom.</em> The first thing we did at Magic Kingdom was take a picture in front of Cinderella's Castle on Main Street. Next, we decided to put on some sunscreen because it was a hot and sunny day.
We then went on some of the rides which included Splash Mountain and the Buzz Lightyear ride. We then went and bought Mickey Ears from one of the stores. </p>

    After the first day in Magic Kingdom, we then went to <em>Epcot.</em> At Epcot, we were able to see some of the different Disney characters that we did not see in Magic Kingdom. We were able to see Jasmine and Mulan in Epcot.
We were also able to go on the Nemo ride and Space Mountain. We were able to travel throughout the world in just one trip and get to see some of the different cultures.</p>

<p style="font-family:candara;">
    On the third day of the trip, we went and tried different foods. For lunch we stopped at the Be Our Guest restaurant and enjoyed the food there. It was a little bit pricey, but it was worth it.
For a sweet treat later in the afternoon, we went and bought some Dole Whip. It is a light and refreshing thing to eat on a hot day.</p>
